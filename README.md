# License and Code of Conduct Explanation
We decided to use the GNU GPL 3.0 License for our project, as it maintains a lot of openess and is a common license type for projects like this.
We decided to use Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, as it covers pretty much everything we'd want for a general explanation of what you should and shouldn't do when working on the project.
